This CLI-based application offers a simple and intuitive interface, enabling users to easily create, edit, and manage their to-do lists without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI). With this app, users can quickly add new tasks, set due dates, and mark completed tasks, all through the convenience of a terminal interface. The TODO app has been designed to be easily portable and platform-independent, enabling users to run it on a wide range of operating systems and devices. The app is also open-source, making it easy for developers to contribute to the project and add new features to the app. With its powerful features and intuitive interface, this CLI-based TODO app is the perfect tool for anyone looking to streamline their workflow and boost their productivity.",tags:[{name:"python",color:"blue-text-gradient"},{name:"json",color:"green-text-gradient"},{name:"todo",color:"pink-text-gradient"}],image:Ce,project_link:[],source_code_link:"https://github.com/DZykov/adventure-cli-todo#Index"},{name:"Console",description:"I have developed a robust and reliable console/terminal implementation in Java, providing users with a powerful and versatile command-line interface for interacting with their applications.
